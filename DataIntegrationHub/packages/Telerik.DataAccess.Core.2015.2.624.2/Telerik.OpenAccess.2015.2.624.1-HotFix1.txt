Telerik OpenAccess Version 2015 Q2 (2015.2.624.1)
Hotfix for SQL Server behavior change.

"select @@version" is used by OpenAccess to determine the version of the connected SQL Server. 
If the version is not detected correctly, insert into tables with autoinc priomary keys fail
and most of the paging queries are executed in memory.
Microsoft has changed the format of the version information with a Sql Server Hotfix without notice.

If "select @@version" returns a string like 

"Microsoft SQL Server 2012 (SP2-CU7) (KB3072100) - 11.0.5623.0 (X64)..."

this hotfix is necessary. The problem is the "(SP2-CU7) (KB3072100)" part.

To use the hotfix in your deployed application, just replace the Telerik.OpenAccess.Runtime.dll with the included one.
There are no other changes included .

You can use the following function to check in your application if this new dll is used:

// add reference to Telerik.OpenAccess.Runtime.dll first
public static bool Check2015_2_624_1_Hotfix1()
{
    var ass = typeof(OpenAccessRuntime.ArrayRangeEnumerator).Assembly;
    if (ass.GetName().Version.ToString() != "2015.2.624.1")
        return false;
    var attr = (AssemblyConfigurationAttribute)ass.GetCustomAttributes(typeof(AssemblyConfigurationAttribute)).Single();
    return attr.Configuration.Contains("including hotfix 1");
}

If you have installed the OpenAccess product, please replace the dll in the products folder and in the global assembly cache.
